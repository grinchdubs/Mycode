Awesome! Feel free to submit an issue or PR. I'd love to hear about what issues
you've run into or how to make this better. And if you want to help in that
endeavor please do!

## Submitting Issues

Please be sure to tell me:

* What you were trying to do...
* What code you tried...
* What you expected to happen...
* And what actually happened.

Any errors (and their full messages) would be very helpful along with the version
of Node you were using.
